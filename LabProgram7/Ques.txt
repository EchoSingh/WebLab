Develop and demonstrate, using Java script , a XHTML document that contains three short paragraphs of text, stacked on top of each other, with only enough of each showing so that the mouse cursor can be placed over some part of them. When the cursor is placed over the exposed part of any paragraph, it should rise to the top to become completely visible. When a paragraph is moved from the top stacking position, it should return to its original position.
